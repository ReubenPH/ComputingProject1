Design Choices
I chose a blue and white aethetic as East Lothian which Haddington is the centre of is where St Andrew saw the cross which inspired Scotlands flag. I put the large picture of the highstreet as the banner as I felt its the centre of people going about.
I used cards in the visit Haddington section as I felt it gave each attraction its own spotlight, and let users access more information if they liked the sound of it.
Challenges
I didn't have a great understanding of bootstrap as I began the project, although I got better with it as I went on. This led to a bit of a strange mix of CSS and bootstrap as I began using more through out the project.
I had some issues with github through out working, due to the univerity computers. I struggled to commit through out working on the project, until I took the files home onto my own personal PC
